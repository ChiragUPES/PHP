PHP (Personal Home Page) 1) Language used for make the webpages dynamic.
                         2) Also known as hypertext pre-processor
                         3) Loosely Types language means we do not need to define the data type of variable.

In php , is data type are there? Yes, internally
a=10      // to assign value
a==10     // value comparison 1=='1' -> True (Value) 
a===10    // Strict comparison(Value+datatype)   1==='1' -> False

for concatenation used -> . Example echo $a."Text";

<?php
$_a=$_REQUEST['uname'];
$_b=$_REQUEST['pass'];
?>
Note: If we use any html tag in php use echo. echo "<br>";

Arrays: In PHP, there are three types of array indexed, associative , mutidimensional array.
                indexed-> array with the numeric index    array('Cars','BMW');
                associative-> having key value pair
                multidimensional-> array containing one or more array

count(array)-> returns the number of elements in array.  

How to traverse indexed array-> for($a=0;$a<count(array);$a++)
                                {
                                  echo $x[$a];
                                  echo "<br>";
                                }

Associatie array: $age = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");
For each loop is : foreach($age as $x=>$x_value)
                   {
                        echo "Key=" .$x.",value=" .$x_value;
                    }
Multi-dimensional:  $cars = array (
                    array("Volvo",22,18),
                    array("BMW",15,13),
                    array("Saab",5,2),
                    array("Land Rover",17,15)
                    );                    
for loop inside for loop:     <?php
                              for ($row = 0; $row < 4; $row++) {
                              echo "<p><b>Row number $row</b></p>";
                              echo "<ul>";
                              for ($col = 0; $col < 3; $col++) {
                              echo "<li>".$cars[$row][$col]."</li>";
                              }
                              echo "</ul>";
                              }
                              ?>    
Sort arrays functions :
sort()-> sort array in ascending order.
rsort()-> sort array in descending order.
asort()-> associative array in ascending order as per value
ksort()-> associative array as per key
arsort()->associative in descending, according to value
krsort()-> associative in descending according to key.
count()-> return the numbers of element in array.
end()-> moves internal pointer to the last
current()-> value of current element in an array
shuffle()-> randomize the order of element in an array.
explode()-> string into an array

File handling:
functions that are used to include the files in the php page.
Below are the functions of file inclusion menas if we create a header in the file and want to use same header in the another page also. so, We can simply include that
file in our code.
include()-> if the file is not present than it will give warning only.
            Syntax->include 'file_name';
include_once-> means if the file is present there than no need to write again.
                Syntax:include_once 'file_name';
require()-> if the file is npt loaded than it will give the error executuion of program will stop.
            require("xxmenu.php"); 
require_once()-> add the code only once. If it is present already than okay otherwise it will give error.

Note:
file_exists("test.txt")
is_readable,is_writable,is_executable
filesize("test.txt")
fgets()-> read a line by line
fread(filename,"10")->read particular bytes from the file. It will read 10 bytes.
fgetc(filename)one character from the line.
copy('file1name','file2name') or die();
rename($fn,$newfn);
unlink(): delete a file 

uploading a file on server: inside form-> method should be post
                                          needs the attribute enctype="multipart/form-data"
                             $_FILES-> returns the information about the files
                            $name=$_FILES['file']['name'];
                            $dir="uploads/";
                            if(isset($_POST['upload'])
                            { 
                                if($_FILES['file']['size']>1000)
                                {
                                  echo "Sorry Large File";
                                }
                                move_uploaded_file($name,$dir.$name);// Take directory and file name as input.
                             }
PHP variable scope: Local,global and static
                    Local-> Variable that is declared inside the function.
                    Global-> variables that are declared outside the function. And global keyword is used to access that variable.
                             Php also stores all the global variables in the array called $GLOBALS[index];
                    Static-> as a function exectued all the local variables are destoyed and on the function calling it will initialized again. But sometimes
                             we want a local variable not to be deleted. So we use Static keyword in php.
                              <?php
                                    function myTest() {
                                      static $x = 0;
                                      echo $x;
                                      $x++;
                                    }

                                    myTest();
                                    myTest();
                                    myTest();
                                    ?> 
                                    Output is: 0 1 2
Array Functions:
1) arrray()-> creates an array
2) array_chunks()-> split the array into chunks of an array.
3) arrays_diff()-> compares two array and return the difference.
4) array_fill(index,number,value)-> fill an array with values.
5) array_merge()-> merge two array into one array
6) array_pop()-> deletes the last element of an array
7) array_push()-> insert one more element to the end of an array.
8) array_reverse()-> return the array in reverse order.
9) array_slice()-> return the selected part of an array.
                    $a=array("red","green","blue","yellow","brown");
                          print_r(array_slice($a,1,2));
                    Output-> Array ( [0] => green [1] => blue ) ;
                          print_r(array_slice($a,2));
                    Output-> Array ( [0] => blue [1] => yellow [2] => brown ) 

Database Connectivity: mysql_connect(servername,username,password);
                                    (localhost,root,"");
default id and password of xampp is -> root and null
$link=mysql_connect(servername,username,pass);
mysql_select_db('databasename',$link);
mysql_query()-> to run a query;
mysql_close().
mysql_fetch_array()-> fetch the record as an associative array. 
                      while($row=mysql_fetch_array($result))
                      {
                          echo $row['firstname']."</td>";
                      }
mysql_num_row>0                      


Cookies and session : Cookie is a small file with maximum size of 4kb that is stored on the client machine by the web server.
                      It is often used to identify the user.When we again send a request to te server than server will authenticate us as per the cookies.
                      setcookie() function in php with wich we can create the cookies.
                      Take certain things as a parameter like-> cookie name, cookie value, expiry time ,security(T/F). True means only on HTTPS
                      cokies can be accessed from anywhere in the project.
            Read from the cookie-> $_COOKIES['cookie name'];
            Check cookies created or not?-> isset($_COOKIE['name']);
            Delete a cookie->   1) if time expires
                                2) if we give negative value 

Sessions: When we do work with an application, we simply open and login to  the application do what we want and than close it. This is much like a session.
          As web server does not know who you are and what you do. So, web server creates an session id and before accesing any page of the applicatoin server
          check wheteher the seeion is created or not.So session variable contains the information about the user.
          session_start()
          $_SESSION['name']="value";
          How to delete a session-> session_destroy() and session_unset();
Navigator used for browser detection.
Magic methods:  These are the functoins that are defined always inside the class. These are __set(for set a data),__get(for read data)
                function that starts with 2 underscore "function __ construct()". used to inializes the value at the time of the creation.
                                                       function __destruct()-> used to destroy the object.(destructor calls automatically when scripts end)
                                                       we can destroy the object using unset() function.



 

Difference bw get and post:             Get                                   Post
                                                                                                                  
                           1)   Not secure as data is shown in URL      |      Secure
                           2)   can be bookmarked                       |     Not bookmarked
                           3)   Get is idempotent. means second request |     Not idemotent
                                will be ignored until response of first | 
                                request is delivered.                   |
                           4)   Limited amount of data is transfered    |     Large as data is sent in body
                                as data is sent in header.              |
